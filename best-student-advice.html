    <h1>Student Advice for attending this Program:</h1>

    <p>I recommend taking a deep surface approach to the lessons during this program.</p>
      <p>You can find the free study path on this webpage.
        <a href="https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com">Learn how to Program</a></p>

    <h2>The Program study path is broken up in the following way:</h2>

    <p><strong>Homework</strong> -> <strong>Morning Warmup</strong> -> <strong>Creative Implementation.</strong></p>

    <h3> Here’s what you should do:</h3>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Follow along with the homework</strong>. Actually do it that night, just follow
                along with the video, don’t think much about it. Do the homework!</li>

        <li><strong>Follow the instructions</strong> the next day. You will likely start with
                implementing the homework from the night before. Just go along with the
                lesson as it’s printed, this is the warm up, don’t skip it.</li>

        <li><strong>Now you can get creative!</strong>. After the homework implementation, you’re
                given an assignment that implements the concepts you just studied in
                a new form. This is where you really learn. You can do it how you want
                (but you will likely really want the information you just learned).</li>
      </ul>
    <p><strong>Finally</strong>, don’t get lost in front-end minutia, unless that’s the lesson or
        you’re done with the day’s assignment. This is the design rabbit hole.
        It’s deep and you’re new, take it easy.</p>

    <p>When you’re about halfway done with your studies at this program, take <strong>some
        steps to make your job search life easier</strong>.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Make a <strong>Portfolio</strong>. Mine is hosted on <em>GitHub Pages</em> for free, using Jekyll,
                with a template. You do not need a hand-built site if you’re not a
                front-end developer, just get one up that looks good and be done with it.</li>

        <li>Get your <strong>LinkedIn</strong> in order. Follow the guide on this program in this
                regard, it paid off for me.</li>
                <p><img src="img/linkedin.png" alt="LinkedIn."></p>

        <li>Get your <strong>Resume</strong> put together. <em>One page</em>. No references to jobs that have
              nothing to do with coding. One page. Write it like some great code, short and
              effective. One page.</li>

        <li>Get a decent <strong>Cover letter</strong> together. You do not need a custom cover
                letter for every job, you just need some parts to be custom.
                I have background information that doesn’t change in my cover letters,
                you can do the same thing.</li>

        <li>The above will take you very far in the general arena of job hunting.
              <strong>Angelist</strong> also allows for sending notes and if you go there, I recommend
              that you send them. Treat these like <em>micro-cover letters</em>. Get a <em>general
              template</em> that you can alter some spots and hammer those out. Make sure your
              <em>Angelist profile</em> is complete though, just like your LinkedIn.</li>
      </ol>
    <p>Thanks for reading!</p>
    <p>I wish all of you, good studies!</p>
