  <h1>New Student Advice:</h1>

    <p>I recommend taking a surface deep approach to the lessons at this program.</p>

  <h2>The Program are broken up in the following way:</h2>

    <p>homework -> morning warmup -> creative implementation.</p>

  <h3> Here’s what you should do:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Follow along in the homework. Actually do it that night, just follow
        along with the video, don’t think much about it. Do the homework.</li>

      <li>Follow the instructions the next day. You will likely start with
        implementing the homework from the night before. Just go along with the
        lesson as it’s printed, this is the warm up, don’t skip it.</li>

      <li>NOW YOU CAN GET CREATIVE. After the homework implementation, you’re
        given an assignment that implements the concepts you just studied in
        a new form. This is where you really learn. You can do it how you want
        (but you will likely really want the information you just learned).</li>
    </ul>

  <p>Finally, don’t get lost in front-end minutia, unless that’s the lesson or
    you’re done with the day’s assignment. This is the design rabbit hole.
    It’s deep and you’re new, take it easy.</p>

  <p>When you’re about halfway done with your studies at program, take some
    steps to make your job search life easier.</p>
    <ol>

      <li>Make a portfolio. Mine is hosted on GitHub Pages for free, using Jekyll,
        with a template. You do not need a hand-built site if you’re not a
        front-end developer, just get one up that looks good and be done with it.</li>

      <li>Get your LinkedIn in order. Follow the guide on this program in this
        regard, it paid off for me.</li>

      <li>Get your Resume put together. One page. No references to jobs that have
      nothing to do with coding. One page. Write it like some great code, short and
      effective. One page.</li>

      <li>Get a decent cover letter together. You do not need a custom cover
        letter for every job, you just need some parts to be custom.
        I have background information that doesn’t change in my cover letters,
        you can do the same thing.</li>

      <li>The above will take you very far in the general arena of job hunting.
      Angelist also allows for sending notes and if you go there, I recommend
      that you send them. Treat these like micro-cover letters. Get a general
      template that you can alter some spots and hammer those out. Make sure your
      Angejlist profile is complete though, just like your LinkedIn.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Thanks for reading!</p>
    <p>I wish all of you, good studies!</p>
